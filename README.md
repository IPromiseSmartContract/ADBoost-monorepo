### Introduction

In a world where traditional advertising is clouded with opacity, ADBoost emerges as a beacon of innovation, leveraging the Ethereum blockchain to usher in a new era of transparency, participation, and equitable rewards in advertising. Our mission is to dismantle the barriers erected by conventional advertising practices, ensuring that every stakeholder in the advertising value chain can verify the impact and reach of campaigns, actively participate in the dissemination of advertisements, and share in the success of advertising endeavors.

### Why ADBoost?

#### Pain Points in Traditional Advertising

- **Trust and Transparency**: The opaque nature of ad click and audience targeting calculations has always been a point of contention.
- **Public Participation**: The existing models exclude the general public from actively participating in and benefiting from the ad dissemination process.
- **Pricing Control**: The control over ad pricing, vested in intermediaries, introduces high levels of uncertainty.
- **Conversion Rate Calculations**: The indirect inference of true conversion rates from impressions to sales poses significant challenges.

#### The ADBoost Solution

ADBoost redefines the advertising landscape by introducing a decentralized platform that ensures:

- **Full Transparency in Campaigns**: Advertisers have clear visibility over their campaigns.
- **Engagement and Rewards for Boosters**: Viewers and spreaders are rewarded for their engagement, fostering a community-driven advertising ecosystem.

### Core Components

1. **Advertisement (AD)**: Leveraging ERC-1155 NFTs, advertisers can craft unique ad campaigns.
2. **Boost Token (BOOST)**: Our reward token, underpinned by Mint Club’s bonding curve protocol, ensures a transparent and equitable reward system.
